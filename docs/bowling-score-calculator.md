# Bowling Score Calculator

American Ten-Pin Bowling has a non-trivial way of calculating the score.

The rules are as follows:
  - each game of bowling includes 10 turns (aka "frames")
  - in each frame, a bowler gets 2 attempts to knock down all 10 pins
  - if in 2 attempts, they fail, the score for that frame is the total number of pins knocked down
  - if in 2 attempts, they succeed (a "spare"), the score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll
  - if on the first try, they knock all the pins down (a "strike"), the score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next 2 rolls
  - if a bowler gets a "spare" in the last frame (the 10th frame), they get 1 bonus roll, with the number of pins knocked down added to the score of the last frame
  - if a bowler gets a "strike" in the last frame (the 10th frame), they get 2 bonus rolls, with the number of pins knocked down added to the score of the last frame

## Tasks

1. Your task is to create a function to calculate the total score in a game of American Ten-Pin Bowling.

   In [src/katas/bowling/core.clj](../src/katas/bowling/core.clj), we have started you off with a function:

   ```clojure
   (defn total-score [rolls])
   ```

   The input, `rolls`, will be a vector of integers, corresponding to the pins knocked down in each roll of a game. For example: `[10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10]` for a perfect game.  You can assume that the input data is always valid.

   In [test/katas/test/bowling.clj](../test/katas/test/bowling.clj) we've provided you a reasonably-comprehensive test set.

   Try to write code as you would expect from your coworkers on a non-trivial production project.

2. If youâ€™d like to have us discuss your solution and compare it to others, please push your code and add a link to your repo to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwO53TlIj367CTodutJNvESWis0tIk4RJH8AiZoPsqs/edit?usp=sharing).
