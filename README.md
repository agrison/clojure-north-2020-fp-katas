# Clojure Katas - Functional Programming (ClojureNorth 2020)

There’s more than one way to solve a problem. This workshop is an opportunity to step out of your Clojure bubble and see how other Clojure developers approach and solve programming challenges.

In the first hour, participants will be tasked with solving 1 (or more) challenge problems, and in the second hour, we will review and discuss the various solutions.

There will be 4 problems, but each participant will only work on 1 (or 2 if there’s time), and then participate in the discussions for all 4. These problems won’t be “puzzles” that require discovering a particularly ingenious solution, but rather, reasonable-scoped “boring” tasks that have been designed to allow for varying kinds of solutions and showcase the strengths (or weaknesses) of Clojure and functional programming.

(For beginners to Clojure, you’ll be welcome to solve the problems in your preferred language, or attempt one of the simpler problems with Clojure).

1st Hour:
 - introduce format and problems
 - participants work on problems

2nd Hour:
 - participants submit their solutions for critique
 - review and discussion of solutions to each problem

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository, then... `lein repl`

To make sure we have a somewhat even distribution of who-works-on-what, to choose your first kata, please run `(rand-nth [:birthday-greeting :mars-rovers :bowling-score :monty-hall])` from the Clojure REPL.

For Clojure beginners, we recommend attempting the [Monty Hall Simulation Proof](/docs/monty-hall-simulation-proof.md).

After you're done with any of the exercises, if you'd like to have them potentially reviewed in Part 2 of the workshop, add a link to your repo to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwO53TlIj367CTodutJNvESWis0tIk4RJH8AiZoPsqs/edit?usp=sharing).
